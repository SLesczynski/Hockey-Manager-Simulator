# Hockey-Manager-Simulator
This is a simple hockey game simulator. Currently, it randomly generates a skill level for all of the players and sets a "favor" for the game.
The game then generates a random number and uses the favor to decide a winner for the game.
In the future I plan on
-Simulation of an entire season
-Ability to control a specific team
-Continue a manager career past the one season
-Complete trades between your team and another team
-Have playoffs
-Keep track of points that each player has through their career
This is a project I am working on during my freetime and currently have no scheduled addition. I will update as time goes on.
